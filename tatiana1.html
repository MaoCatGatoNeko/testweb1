Tatiana de la Tierra was born in Colombia, where she was a polite,
cheerful girl who wore frilly dresses and ruffled underwear and frolicked
among the fields of coffee and sugar cane. This all came to an end when
she relocated to Miami with her family when she was just seven years old.
This pissed her off, which explains why she says "Bitch", "Fuck You" and
"No Me Joda" a lot.  Still, little Tatiana enjoyed becoming an American.
Where else can you learn to masturbate while invoking Donny Osmond from
the posters in your bedroom wall?  For her twenty-first birthday, Tatiana
became an earth momma and went to live on the Planet of Lesbos, where she
became a feminist vegetarian lesbian-separatist massage therapist who wore
Birkenstocks.  This got boring after a while, so she became a smut
photographer, a cocaine dealer and a reader for 1-800-Bruja-For-A-Buck.
Then she got busted and went into hiding, which is how she made it to El
Paso.  Tatiana has led a very complicated life and, as a result, she
became a writer.  She's had all sorts of writings published, all over the
place, but we are not at liberty to name them because, after all, she is a
fugitive and living anonymously.  Currently, Tatiana is a prisoner of
UTEP's MFA Creative Writing Program, where her soft-spoken demeanor and
pleasant personality make her a favorite among her students, professors
and colleagues.
